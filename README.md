# shot_locker

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

For the new flutter developer:

In this app data about the golf is fetched from the backend database and a login or signup is required which then generates a token and it gets saved in the memory of the device then the token is used to fetch all the other details of that user through different apis given in postman and api manager in the config folder.

After that UI's of this app are made in a dark theme you can figure that much stuff out. There's no bug till now but new code always makes bugs in old code so Goodluck :).# shot-locker
